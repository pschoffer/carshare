## Hyundai IONIQ Electric

How cool is it, that you decided to share electric car via [snappcar](https://www.snappcar.se/hyra-bil/bil/hyundai-ioniq-electric/f11b78ca-48e8-4b32-96bf-efb04dc63633) ?! :)

### Car info

Fully electric great car. Meaning it is great fun to drive and you can save a lot on energy costs. The back seats are fully foldable to create a nice platform to move furniture. The car does NOT have a hitch for a trailer though.

It has relativelly small baterry of 28kwh, but it is one of the most efficient electric cars. So it can still do close to 200km if the conditions are good (no rain, no heating, not over 110 kmh).

There are some more [stats](https://evcompare.io/cars/hyundai/hyundai-ioniq-electric-28-kwh/) you can check if you are interested.

### Charging

In most cases I will try to borrow the car with close to full batery. If you would return the car bellow 70% of charge please let me know in advance. In general anything above 40-50% is fine as I can easily charge it at home or close by, but I stil like to know so I can plan.

To charge the car you have 3 options:

#### Regular power outlet

The most convenient option if you have the car for multiple days and have access to outdoors outlet. The cable is in the trunk. It takes quite a lot of time though (6-10 hours) so it is only really a viable option overnight or as an emergency.
